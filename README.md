## Project Overview
This project focuses on generating and analyzing signals (e.g., sine waves, square waves, etc.) using MATLAB. The code is structured using **design patterns** and adheres to **SOLID principles** to ensure modularity, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

---

## Features
- Generate various types of signals:
  - Sine waves
  - Square waves
  - Triangular waves
  - Custom signals
- Analyze signals (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase).
- Modular and extensible codebase.
- Examples demonstrating design patterns and SOLID principles.

## Design Patterns Used
1. **Factory Pattern**:
   - Used to create different types of signals (e.g., sine, square, triangular) without exposing the creation logic.
2. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - Allows dynamic selection of signal analysis algorithms at runtime.
3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - Notifies users or systems when a new signal is generated or analyzed.

## SOLID Principles Applied
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class has a single responsibility (e.g., `SignalGenerator` only generates signals, `SignalAnalyzer` only analyzes signals).
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - The code is open for extension (e.g., adding new signal types) but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Derived classes (e.g., `SineWave`, `SquareWave`) can replace their base class (`Signal`) without affecting functionality.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Interfaces are specific to client needs (e.g., `ISignalGenerator`, `ISignalAnalyzer`).
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules (e.g., `SignalProcessor`) depend on abstractions (e.g., `ISignal`) rather than concrete implementations.
